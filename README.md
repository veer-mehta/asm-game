# Assembly Game Project

## About
This project is a classic-style game built entirely in 8086 assembly language using Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM). It showcases low-level programming concepts and techniques unique to the x86 architecture, creating a retro gaming experience.

## Requirements
- **DOSBox**: An x86 emulator that allows running DOS applications, essential for running MASM programs on modern systems.

## How to Run
1. Open **DOSBox**.
2. Navigate to the project folder using the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```
3. Run the game executable:
   ```bash
   shooting
   ```

Enjoy the nostalgia and challenge of assembly-based gaming!
